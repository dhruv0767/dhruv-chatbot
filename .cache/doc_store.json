The height is the\\ndimension perpendicular to the length.\\n2.3 Minimum Flexibility Criteria for Flat-Size Pieces\\nFlat-size pieces must be flexible. Boxes—with or without hinges, gaps, or breaks\\nthat allow the piece to bend—are not flats. Tight envelopes or wrappers that are\\nfilled with one or more boxes are not flats. At the customer’s option, a customer\\nmay perform the following test on his or her mailpieces.

When\\ndetermining variance in thickness, exclude the outside edges of a mailpiece\\n(1 inch from each edge) when the contents do not extend into those edges. Also,\\nexclude the selvage of any polywrap covering (see 201.5.3) from this\\ndetermination. Mailers must secure nonpaper contents to prevent shifting of\\nmore than 2 inches within the mailpiece if shifting would cause the piece to be\\nnonuniform in thickness or would result in the contents bursting out of the\\nmailpiece (see 601.3.3).\\n2.5 Ineligible Flat-Size Pieces\\nFlat-size mailpieces that do not meet the eligibility standards in 2.3 and 2.4 are\\nconsidered parcels, and customers mailing these pieces must pay the applicable\\nparcel prices.\\n3.0 Physical Standards for Parcels\\n3.1 Processing Categories\\nUSPS categorizes parcels into one of three mail processing categories:\\nmachinable, irregular, or nonmachinable parcel. These categories are based on\\nthe physical dimensions of the piece, regardless of the placement (orientation) of\\nthe delivery address on the piece. For additional information on machinable,\\nirregular, and nonmachinable processing categories, see 201.7.0.\\n3.2 Maximum Weight and Size\\n[7-9-23] All parcels must be large enough to hold the required delivery address,\\nreturn address, mailing labels, postage, barcode, endorsements, and other mail\\nmarkings on the address side of the parcel. For mailability, all pieces 1/4 inch\\nthick or less must be a minimum of 5 inches in length, 3-1/2 inches in height, and\\n0.007 inch in thickness. No mailpiece may weigh more than 70 pounds. Except\\nfor USPS Ground Advantage – Retail, which may not measure more than\\n130 inches in length and girth combined, no mailpiece may measure more than\\n108 inches in length and girth combined. For parcels, length is the distance of\\nthe longest dimension and girth is the distance around the thickest part. Lower\\nsize or weight standards apply to mail addressed to some APOs and FPOs\\nsubject to 703.2.0 and 703.4.0 and for Department of State mail, subject to\\n703.3.0.\\n3.3 Two or More Packages\\nWith the exception of USPS-produced Flat Rate Envelopes and Boxes, two or\\nmore packages may be mailed as a single parcel, if they are about the same size\\nor shape, if they are securely wrapped or fastened together, and if they do not\\ntogether exceed the weight or size limits.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"FWUqjtplU3Fnkf3Vxceuw4DJBBBGoqCF+Ej7pMXS048=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/101.pdf_4":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/101.pdf_4\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":4,\"total_pages\":8,\"file_path\":\"/Users/dhruv/Desktop/v2/dhruv-chatbot/data/101.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"101.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Domestic Mail Manual • Updated 7-9-23\\n101101.6.1\\nRetail Mail: Physical Standards for Letters, Cards, Flats, and Parcels\\n4.0 Additional Physical Standards for Priority Mail Express\\nEach piece of Priority Mail Express may not weigh more than 70 pounds.
